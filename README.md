# Internet of Things Networking Session:

## Part 1: Build a Simple Sensor App!
So you've probably all heard of the "Internet of Things." It's a big trending industry and especially as healthcare professionals, it's important to understand the main concepts behind it. 

# Step 0: Download Necessary Software

1. Arduino: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. 

Hardware List:

1. Arduino Uno Chip
2. Circuit Board
3. 3 Wires
4. Sensor (temperature, distance, etc.)

# Step 1:
Open up Arduino and setup the necessary libraries. 
Your file should look like this:

```
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:  
}

void loop() {
  // main code goes here: runs in a loop
}
```
